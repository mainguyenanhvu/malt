# malt
Malt is a small package for converting .pdb molecular geometry files into TRIPOS .mol2 files, crucially including atomic partial charges as a fourth co-ordinate for each constituent atom. It is limited in its scope, and is likely to be updated sporadically only if useful to my research. It is free to use for all that may find it useful.
